                    <h2>About Luca</h2>
                    <p class="double">Luca, a lifeguard by profession, found himself unexpectedly floating in a sea of uncertainty when he was laid off from his job. However, amidst the waves of change, he discovered a newfound passion for making bread. Guided by his love for artisanal craftsmanship and a desire to create something truly special, Luca embarked on an extraordinary journey that would transform his life forever.</p>
                    <p>
                        With a burning curiosity and a hunger for knowledge, Luca delved into the art of bread-making. Armed with determination and an insatiable appetite for experimentation, he kneaded, shaped, and baked his way through countless batches of dough. It didn't take long for his creations to capture the hearts and taste buds of those fortunate enough to sample his handcrafted loaves.

                Luca's sourdough bread became the heart and soul of his bakery, reflecting his unwavering commitment to quality and authenticity. Crafted without the use of store-bought or commercial yeast, each loaf is a testament to Luca's dedication to traditional baking methods. With every gentle knead and careful shaping, the bread emerges as a labor of love, meticulously prepared over a slow fermentation process lasting 14-17 hours.
            </p>
            <p>
                But Luca's passion for excellence doesn't stop there. He believes in preserving the integrity of his ingredients and their impact on the environment. That's why he insists on using organic flour, ensuring that only the purest and most natural elements go into his creations. The water used in his bread-making process is meticulously filtered, and the electricity powering his ovens comes from sustainable solar energy sources. Luca's commitment to sustainability resonates in every bite, allowing customers to savor not only the taste but also the knowledge that they are supporting a bakery with a conscience.

                Beyond the delectable flavors and wholesome ingredients, Luca's sourdough bread holds a secret: its remarkable digestibility. Unlike commercially produced bread that is mixed and baked within a mere few hours, Luca's sourdough undergoes a slow fermentation process. This natural process breaks down gluten and phytic acid, resulting in a bread that is gentler on the stomach and easier to digest. For those who have experienced discomfort or felt "clogged up" after eating bread, Luca's sourdough is a refreshing and nourishing alternative.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, Luca's bakery stands as a testament to his unwavering commitment to the craft, sustainability, and the pure joy of sharing the artisanal bread experience. Each loaf that emerges from Luca Loaves carries the essence of his journey, a dedication to quality, and a love for bread that transcends mere sustenance.
